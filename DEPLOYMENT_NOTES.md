# JABV Labs Deployment Guidelines

## Deployment Priority

**Primary Platform: Render**
- Render should be the primary deployment platform for JABV Labs projects
- Vercel is secondary and less important for production deployments
- Focus development and optimization efforts on Render compatibility

## Website Performance Optimizations (Completed)

The following optimizations have been implemented in PR #7:

### Loading Performance
- Reduced loading screen duration from 600ms to 200ms
- Fixed typewriter animation glitch with consistent 100ms timing
- Optimized initial page load sequence

### Mobile UX Improvements
- Fixed "Our Work" section alignment issues in mobile view
- Improved responsive scaling across all components
- Enhanced touch interactions for mobile devices

### Carousel Enhancements
- Implemented seamless infinite scrolling for portfolio carousel
- Added user interaction handling (pauses auto-scroll when user interacts)
- Fixed tech stack carousel animation speed (reduced from 30s to 15s)
- Eliminated abrupt resets in carousel animations

### Interactive Features
- Added scroll-triggered animations to services section
- Enhanced hover effects and transitions
- Improved accessibility with better focus states

## Technical Notes

### Environment Configuration
- Vite configuration updated for better dependency resolution
- Preserved symlinks set to false for better module resolution
- File system access configured for development

### Testing
- All changes tested with Vercel preview deployment
- CI checks passing (2 passed, 0 failed)
- Ready for Render deployment once merged to main

## Next Steps

1. Merge PR #7 to main branch (requires manual user action)
2. Configure Render deployment pipeline
3. Test optimizations on Render platform
4. Monitor performance metrics post-deployment
