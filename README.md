JABV Labs Website Project
Overview
Welcome to the JABV Labs website project! This repository contains the source code for a professional, interactive website for JABV Labs, a US-based full-stack development company headquartered in Reno, Nevada. The site targets businesses and individuals seeking mobile app development (iOS/Android), modern interactive websites, and website redesigns. The design is inspired by Apple’s sleek, modern aesthetic, featuring a red and black dark theme with engaging, self-guiding layouts.
Project Goals

Create a clean, responsive website using Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
Showcase services: Mobile App Development, Interactive Websites, and Website Redesigns.
Ensure a premium user experience with psychological color and layout design.
Secure the site with HTTPS and optimize for search engine visibility, targeting Reno and broader US markets.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), vanilla JavaScript.
Design Inspiration: Apple.com (e.g., Store section) for elegance and intuitiveness.
Hosting: Render (custom domain jabvlabs.com).
Domain: Managed via IONOS with A record (216.24.57.1) and CNAME (www to jabvwebsiecodebase.onrender.com).
SSL: IONOS-managed wildcard SSL (*.jabvlabs.com) with Render-issued certificates.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository: git clone <repository-url> (replace with your repo URL).
Install Dependencies: No external packages required—uses vanilla JS and Tailwind CSS (included in HTML via CDN).
Run Locally: Open index.html in a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for a static preview.
Deploy: Push changes to Render via the configured Git integration (contact support if needed).

Development Process
Initial Design and Features

Homepage: Features a hero section with "Build Your Future with JABV Labs" headline, "Expert App & Web Development" subtitle, and a "Get a Quote" CTA button. Includes an infinite-scrolling portfolio carousel with 10 mockup examples.
Services Page: Three sections for app development, interactive websites, and redesigns, each with icons, descriptions, and "Learn More" buttons with hover animations.
About Page: Showcases a brief company story (placeholder text), a tech stack carousel (40+ languages, frameworks, cloud platforms, ML tools), and mission statement ("Delivering innovative digital solutions").
Contact Page: Separate page with an interactive form (name, email, message) featuring validation and a success message on submit, plus clickable phone (775) 800-5850 and email contact@jabvlabs.com.
Navigation: Sticky header with "JABV Labs" logo, menu (Home, Services, About, Contact), and mobile-friendly hamburger menu. Buttons highlight red with white underlines on hover.
Footer: Links to services, contact info, and social media icons (Twitter, LinkedIn), with copyright © 2025 JABV Holdings LLC.

Enhancements

Design Refinement: Shifted to a red and black dark theme with subtle gradients, backdrop blur, and floating particle animations for a modern, Apple-inspired look.
Service Pages: Added dedicated pages for Mobile App Development, Interactive Websites, and Website Redesigns, each with headlines, intros, "Why Choose Us" sections, processes, key features (e.g., Native iOS/Android, Responsive Design), tech stacks (JavaScript, React Native, Next.js, PostgreSQL), and "Get a Quote" CTAs.
Interactivity: Implemented smooth scrolling, infinite carousel loops, and hover effects using vanilla JS.
Marketing Focus: Emphasized custom development, avoiding mention of AI-built or template services (e.g., WordPress, WIX).

Challenges and Solutions

DNS Configuration: Initial conflicts with IONOS’s "Default Site" records were resolved by updating A and CNAME records. Domain Guard was managed to allow changes.
SSL Setup: Manual CSR generation was unnecessary due to IONOS’s managed wildcard SSL, confirmed active.
Development Bugs: Fixed JavaScript errors (e.g., mlTech variable) and optimized UX with Replit agent assistance.

Current Status

Live: https://jabvlabs.com is accessible via the propagated A record.
Pending: https://www.jabvlabs.com awaits full CNAME propagation (expected by 09:25 PM PDT, Tuesday, June 24, or Wednesday, June 25, 2025).
Features: All pages are functional with recent updates (e.g., navigation routing, service links) deployed on Render.

SEO Strategy

Keywords: Targeting “Reno app development,” “Reno web design,” “Reno website redesign,” and “affordable app development Reno.”
On-Page: Plan to update titles, meta descriptions, and headings with keywords post-propagation.
Technical: Will optimize load speed, ensure mobile-friendliness, and submit to Google Search Console.
Local: Intends to claim a Google Business Profile and add NAP (Name, Address, Phone) to the footer.
Content: Plans for blog posts like “5 Reasons to Redesign Your Reno Website in 2025” to boost organic traffic.
